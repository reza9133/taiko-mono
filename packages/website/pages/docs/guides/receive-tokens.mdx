# Receive tokens

## Overview

This guide will help you receive testnet tokens from the faucet(s).

## Prerequisites

- You have an Ethereum wallet address to accept the testnet tokens.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Receive Sepolia ETH
    Visit one of the faucets to receive ETH on Sepolia:
      - [sepolia-faucet.pk910.de](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de)
      - [faucet-sepolia.rockx.com](https://faucet-sepolia.rockx.com)
      - [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
      - [infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://infura.io/faucet/sepolia)
      - [faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)
      - [coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet](https://coinbase.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia-faucet)
      - [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link)

    ### Receive HORSE
    Navigate to [the bridge](https://bridge.test.taiko.xyz), select HORSE from the dropdown, and click "Faucet".

    ### Receive BLL
    Repeat the previous step for receiving HORSE, except select "BLL" from the dropdown.

    ### Receive TTKO
    Some TTKO was distributed to previous network participants shortly after the launch of alpha-3, and you can see those transactions [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x19B4F9C381C7927FE33D853e48b560141A380C44).
    
    It's possible more will be distributed, especially considering those that did not run a proposer/prover in alpha1/alpha2, and those who are new to the Taiko community.
    
    Otherwise, you can obtain TTKO from [Swap](https://swap.test.taiko.xyz), successfully [proving blocks](/docs/guides/enable-a-prover), or perhaps from asking a community member on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/taikoxyz).
